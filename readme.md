# Smart Library Environment Monitoring System

An IoT-based intelligent system designed to monitor indoor environmental conditions and regulate fan, lighting, and notification systems to prevent mold formation and maintain a comfortable, quiet, and energy-efficient library atmosphere.

---

## Objective

To monitor indoor environmental conditions and automatically regulate **ventilation**, **lighting**, and **alerts** to prevent **mold formation** and ensure an optimal atmosphere in the library.

---

## Features

- **Smart Lighting**: Adjusts LED brightness based on ambient light.
- **Climate Control**: Activates fan based on indoor temperature and humidity.
- **Noise Monitoring**: Detects noise levels and alerts visually via LED/OLED.
- **Occupancy Detection**: Tracks presence using a PIR sensor.
- **Weather-Based Mold Risk**: Uses Weather API to estimate mold risk and sends notifications.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: View real-time and historical sensor data (coming soon).
- **AI Planning**: Optional future integration to manage device actions based on long-term goals.
